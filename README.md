# LocusMapTweak

These files are needed to extend online map providers in Locus Maps.
The `providers.xml` is the essential file to update on your Locus Maps installation. The icons are just for decoration.

---

## Installation

### Do it yourself

Copy the file `"providers.xml"` (find it in this repo) and all icons into this directory:

    ...\Locus\mapsOnline\custom

### Do it with the app

The Locus Map Tweak app is no longer on the Google Play store, but you can still download and side-load the APK from other sources, like: <http://locus-addon-map-tweak.apk.watch/3.2.2>

*But...* that site hasn't been updated with changes found in this repository and adding the files manually as described above is fairly straight forward / **much safer.**

## Other Notes

### Add your contributions

If you want to contribute to `providers.xml`, you can find or fix maps following [documentation found on the Locus Map site](http://docs.locusmap.eu/doku.php?id=manual:advanced:customization:online_maps)

Feel free to submit PRs or send me changes you make and I will update this repository.

### Forked with updates from

The original author of this collection appears to have abandoned it.  I have taken the PRs made against [that repo](https://github.com/mjk912/LocusMapTweak) and merged them here.
